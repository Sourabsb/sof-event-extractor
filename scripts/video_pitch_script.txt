## Video Duration: 5 minutes

---

### **INTRO (30 seconds)**

**[Scene: Clean background with SoF Event Extractor logo]**

**Narrator**: "The shipping industry processes thousands of Statement of Facts documents daily, with port agents spending 2-4 hours manually extracting event data from each document. This manual process is prone to errors, difficult to scale, and creates operational bottlenecks."

**[Scene: Show stack of maritime documents, tired worker highlighting text manually]**

"What if we could automate this entire process using AI?"

### **SOLUTION OVERVIEW (45 seconds)**

**[Scene: Architecture diagram animation]**

**Narrator**: "Introducing the SoF Event Extractor - an AI-powered solution that transforms unstructured maritime documents into structured, actionable data in under 30 seconds."

**[Architecture components appear one by one]**

"Our system combines multiple technologies:
- React frontend with maritime-themed UI
- FastAPI backend for high-performance processing  
- Multi-layered AI extraction using regex, spaCy NLP, and GPT models
- OCR processing with Azure Cognitive Services
- Structured export in JSON and CSV formats"

### **LIVE DEMO (2.5 minutes)**

**[Scene: Screen capture of the application]**

**Narrator**: "Let me show you how it works."

#### **Step 1: Upload (20 seconds)**
**[Navigate to homepage]**

"Users are greeted with a clean, maritime-themed interface. Simply drag and drop your Statement of Facts document, or click to browse."

**[Demonstrate file upload with sample SoF PDF]**

"The system supports PDF, Word documents, and even scanned images through OCR."

#### **Step 2: Processing (30 seconds)**
**[Show processing screen with real-time updates]**

"Once uploaded, our AI pipeline springs into action:
1. Document parsing extracts raw text
2. Our maritime-trained models identify port events
3. Regex and spaCy handle standard patterns
4. GPT provides intelligent fallback for complex cases
5. All events are validated and structured"

**[Show processing progress and status updates]**

#### **Step 3: Results (45 seconds)**
**[Display results table]**

"Within seconds, we have a comprehensive table of extracted events:"

**[Highlight different columns]**
- "Event types like arrivals, departures, loading operations
- Precise timestamps with start and end times  
- Port locations and berth information
- Duration calculations and additional descriptions"

**[Show filtering and sorting features]**
"Users can filter by location, event type, and sort chronologically."

#### **Step 4: Visualization (30 seconds)**
**[Open timeline view]**

"For deeper insights, our timeline visualization shows:
- Chronological event flow
- Duration analysis  
- Hourly distribution patterns
- Operational bottlenecks and efficiency metrics"

#### **Step 5: Export (25 seconds)**
**[Demonstrate export functionality]**

"Finally, export your structured data as CSV for spreadsheet analysis, or JSON for system integration. Perfect for feeding into existing maritime management systems, analytics platforms, or compliance reporting."
